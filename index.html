              Our kids are our priority when evaluating who to support. Small
              funds have been set up at various levels of our schools. The goal
              is provide kids who are at a financial disadvantage with the means
              that will allow them to participate in their school and
              extracurricular activities. Our hope is to assist our kids so
              their talents and their dreams are supported.

              Springfield’s families are our family. We reach out to each other
              when things get hard. It could be as simple as providing a house
              cleaning, a cooked meal a lawn mowed. Sadly, much of our
              assistance comes when catastrophe strikes. It is our goal to take
              some of the financial strain off of our friends and neighbors.

            individuals. By providing families with the temporary means to
            participate in school, engage in their community and remain in their
            homes, we’re making sure every Springfield resident knows they are
            important and they matter.
