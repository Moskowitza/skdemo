            Shane Joseph Halligan had dreams of joining the military. He admired
            all the veterans, especially those who served in World War II. He
            was taking flying lessons in the hopes of serving and protecting his
            country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shane earned the respect of others through hard work and showing
            initiation by becoming an Eagle Scout and joining the Oreland Fire
            Company on the first day he was eligible. He was going to become a
            pilot with hopes of enlisting in the Air National Guard after high
            school. He wanted to protect us all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, on Dec. 12, 2006, he took his own life at the age of 16. His
            family’s tragedy is a shared tragedy that affected so many in his
            township.

          life and to honor who he would have become.

            Every child here in our community deserves to be seen, their dreams

          >Shane’s story isn’t one of a life unlived, rather it’s how his
          guidance allowed us to help others so that they may know that they are
          important and they matter. Acts of kindness between one another
          promote unity, love, compassion and empathy. Shane’s Kindness is
          devoted to strengthening our community by spreading acts of kindness,
          small and large, to help support and encourage those in need.

          Shane’s parents John and Donna, along with his siblings Kara and
          Chris, started Shane’s Kindness following Shane’s death at the age of
          16. Shane’s Kindness was founded to heal and give back to a community
          that had been wounded and traumatized by the sudden loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve helped Springfield residents help others in their community for
          13 years, following Shane’s inspiration to make a difference in the
          lives of at-risk students and their families. Since our founding,
          thanks to the generosity of those in our community and beyond, we’ve
          distributed more than $450,000 across our community. We want to ensure
          that every child, every family, is supported in their time of need. We
          want every individual to know they are important, they are vital to
          our community and they are loved.
        </p>

          Springfield helping Springfield. Your acts of kindness foster
          community and effect change right here at home. The best example we
          can set for our children is to show them love, compassion and kindness
          for each other. We’re all in this together.
